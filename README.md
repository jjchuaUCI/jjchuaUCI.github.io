Personal Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with help from Bootstrap and MDB.

This portfolio was built as a project for Informatics 133 at UCI. There was a lot of user research and testing that went into creating this portfolio to get the optimal results as far as what users of this website would want and need.

The research can be accessed through the navigation bar.

Enjoy!
