       <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
       <p>
         I am a fourth year Computer Science major at the University of California, Irvine.
       </p>
       <p>
         I chose to become a computer sciene major because of my love for technology and computers. Back in my senior year of high school, I built my own desktop computer so that I could play video games and that sealed the deal for me. Even though I was interested in the hardware side at first, my full interest is now in programming and that has led me here!

        <h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
        <h2>DREAMS FOR SCHOOLS</h2>
        <p>I worked with Dreams for Schools on their AppJam+ initiative where we taught middle school kids the basics of coding. The program aims to introduce kids to programming by helping them make their own Android game with custom sprites, sounds, etc. Along with tutoring the kids, additional responsibilities included working with the other mentors to come up with an appropriate and fun experience!</p>
        
        <h2>SOLAR POWERED CLOCK</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team of engineers to build a solar powered clock from scratch. I worked on various different aspects of the clock such as fabrication and electrical wiring. My biggest role with this project was determining how to light up an array of LEDs with only a few connections to an Arduino available.</p>
        
        <h2>DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>A course where I learned to how to create multiple types of data structures such as binary trees and arrays using different data types like linked lists and hash tables. I also implemented an extended version of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++ to identify the shortest paths in a graph. Finally, I learned how to analyze algorithms using Big-O notation.</p>
        
        <h2>PROGRAMMING WITH SOFTWARE LIBRARIES</h2>
        <p>In this class I experimented with different software libraries to create multiple programs. The first was a navigation system in Python used to explore the computer's file system using different command inputs. I also gained experience with APIs by using the MapQuest API to build a text-based navigation system. For the final project I built the back and front end of an Othello game with its own GUI using Python as well.</p>
