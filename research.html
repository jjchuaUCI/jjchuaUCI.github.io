It is important to ask questions that the users can elaborate on in order to get the most out of the interviews.

Their values are determined by multiple criteria like user and business value. I selected my features based on the answers from my user interviews and the results from the competitor analysis.

			<h2 class="display-3">Summary of Findings</h2>

			<hr class="my-4">
			<p class="lead">
				This entire process has really opened my eyes as to how to create a portfolio website with important features that users would want. The research done at the beginning of the process was helpful because it gave me an idea of what features I should include into my site. Because of this, it was easy to start to design my site because I already had all of the important features in mind before writing any HTML or CSS.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				After conducting user tests, it also became apparent which parts of the interface I could improve on. Many of the users wanted more info about my skills and experience. Some parts of my portfolio are misleading because the users tried to click on areas that had no functionality. Many users also said that the design of the site could be better, which I agree with. They pointed out that the design did the job, but it wasnâ€™t very visually appealing.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				The tests were also very helpful because it showed what users expect from my portfolio and what their thought process was when seeing the site for the first time. It was easy to find my contact information and presumably any other section of the site since they are all listed out and easy to see. It is also apparent as to what the purpose of the site is after conducting the question test.

			<h2 class="display-3">INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS
			</h2>

			<hr class="my-4">
			<p class="lead">
				The main things that I plan to incorporate for my portfolio is a revamped design and adding more past projects. These are the main things that users commented on when conducting the cognitive walkthroughs and when creating the user stories. These are also the highest ranked priorities on my feature value matrix, so it makes sense that they should be the best aspects of my site.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				I want to redesign the site because at the moment it is not very aesthetically pleasing. I plan on creating a new layout for it while keeping the ease of use in terms of being able to identify the different sections of the site. I plan to do this by using frameworks like Bootstrap in my design. I am also studying different sites and trying to incorporate better colors and media in my portfolio.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				I also plan on having a section for my projects instead of just having my experience. I realized that having projects naturally shows what kind of experience I have so it adds more important details to the page without sacrificing anything. I will add these features with thumbnails and links to GitHub repositories so that the users of the site can look into them if they want to. I think this feature would greatly add to the functionality of my website because it provides more information about the skills that I have.
